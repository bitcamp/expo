An opportunity to pitch the program to the College Park City Council and sell the city the rights to use it.","The City of College Park is a city of approximately 32,000 people, located in Prince George's County, in the suburbs of Washington, DC, and the home of the flagship campus of the University of Maryland system. The city government (www.collegeparkmd.gov) provides several services to its residents, including economic planning and development, code enforcement, parking enforcement, public safety, youth, family and senior services, and public works (including trash and recycling pickup). The public schools in College Park are part of the Prince George's County Public School system, a separate entity. The primary police coverage is provided by the Prince George's County Police Department, although the city contracts with Prince George's County to provide additional police coverage, and also receives police services in some neighborhoods from the University of Maryland Police Department.

The city is looking for a web-based or mobile-based program that could enhance the services it provides to College Park residents. Some examples of programs could include the following:

--a a website or app to report geographically tagged problems to the city to fix

--a website or app to track streets plowed by the city after a snowstorm and when they were plowed

--a website or app to track important events taking place in the city and advertise them to residents

--a website or app to highlight features of the city to prospective residents and visitors

--a website or  app to help residents and contractors navigate the permitting system in College Park

--a website or app to track and map crime incidents and provide push notifications of public safety incidents

The city is providing $1,000 that will be made available to the winner of the app contest. Participants are asked to put together a marketing and development plan to lay out how these funds will be put to use. Entries will be judged by the Mayor and members of the College Park City Council to select the website or app most likely to benefit College Park residents, as well as who determines the best way to spend the $1,000 to develop the program. The winner will be recognized at an upcoming meeting of the College Park City Council and have an opportunity to pitch the program and propose a price to sell to the city the rights to use the program.
